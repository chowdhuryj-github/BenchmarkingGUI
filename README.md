# The Benchmarking GUI Lab Collection
Welcome to the Benchmarking GUI Lab Collection! This repository is a data structures project that I've worked on during my freshman year at the Milwaukee School of Engineering!

## Lab 6 | Benchmarking Implementations
Created a program that is able to generate benchmark results that generate graphs to show the amount of time it takes for each of the list implementations to complete each operations as a function of the number of elements stored in that list. The list implementations and the operations are as follows:

### List Implementations
* the ```java.util.ArrayList``` implementation
* the ```java.util.Linkedlist``` implementation
* the ```datastructures.ArrayList``` implementation
* the ```datastructures.LinkedList``` implementation
* the ```datastructures.LinkedListTurbo``` implementation

### List Operations 
* the ```addToFront``` operation — Adding to the front of the list
* the ```indexedContain``` operation — Iterating through the list using an index (calling get()) to find a match
* the ```contains``` operation — Determining if a value is in the list using contains()

## Lab 7 | Benchmarking Analysis
Created a word document with written Big-O analysis for all List implementations. Modified the program to have the generated pictrues saved in a folder as a .png image. The program is also modified to support command line arguments.
